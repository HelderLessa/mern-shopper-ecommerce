# E-commerce Web Application

This is a responsive e-commerce web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). The project demonstrates the implementation of a modern online store with user authentication, product listings, and cart management functionalities.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Product Management:** Display of products with details such as name, price, and description fetched from a MongoDB database.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add products to the cart, update quantities, and manage their orders.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **React Router:** For navigation between pages.
- **Fetch API:** For making HTTP requests to the backend.

### Backend

- **Node.js:** For building the server-side logic.
- **Express:** For handling routes and middleware.
- **MongoDB:** As the database for storing user and product information.
- **Mongoose:** For managing database operations and schemas.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure user authentication.
- **bcrypt:** For hashing user passwords.
